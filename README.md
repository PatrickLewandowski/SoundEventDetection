# SoundEventDetection

The aim of this project is to detect audio events on streaming input using deep learning. The model was trained on a popular Weakly Labeled Datasets (WLD) called audioset and used Attention Neural Networks for prediction. 

A detailed project report is provided in SoundEventDetection.pdf.
